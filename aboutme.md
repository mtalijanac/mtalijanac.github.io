My name is Marko Talijanac. I do Java for living. 
I do these essays to clear my mind, to sort out my thoughts..
I hope you'll find value in them.
I hope you'll like it.


### My story

To be honest, it isn't story of conquest and deception.
I went into school. I went into a college. 
Got a great job. Still there.
Found a love. Became a father.
Do enjoy summer barbecues...
